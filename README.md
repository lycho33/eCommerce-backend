# Mini-Store Backend

This is the basic backend Rails API for React. 

If you are following along and want to install this backend, feel free to fork and clone this repo. 

##Usage

After installing this repo run

    $ bundle install
    $ rails db:migrate
    $ rails db:seed

This should set up your database and allow you to start your server on port 4000.

    $ rails server

Then visit your port of 4000

Afterwards you can visit the frontend

    $ https://github.com/lycho33/ecommerce-frontend

Don't forget to fork and clone it so you can have both the API and React servers running. Afterwards, I hope you enjoy the App!
